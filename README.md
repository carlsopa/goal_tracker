# Goal Tracker

## History
It is the new year, and it is a time where we all think of our goals for the new year.  My goal this year, is to create one new project a month.  These could either be hardware or software.  And so, it is only fitting that my first project on this journey is Goal Tracker.  I would be remissed if I did not say, that this project was inspired by a prompt for the first hackathon over at [Mint Bean](mintbean.io).

## Overview
There are many ways, to keep track of goals.  You could use a sticky note on a wall or fridge.  Or the more tech enclined might use one of the hundreds of spreadsheet options out there.  There are numerous apps, and websites to also assist.  So, why not one more.  I must thank Michelle, for her support and beta testing and providing user feedback.

The idea is to make it as simple as possible.  From the menu's to the display, I tried to keep simplicity in mind.  We have a hard enough time following through on our goals, and so why make it more complicated, with a complicated UI.

## Features
I have added features, that I think are kinda unique and novel:
1) Daily tracker- on the main page, is a tracker, that will keep track of your daily goals.  It will allow you to see how many you have completed, vs how many are labeled as daily repeats.
2) Color coordinated- at a quick glance from the goal screen, you will be able to tell what are your repeated goals, and its repetition value, as well as those that are longer term goals.
3) Notes and journals- It is a journey, to obtain our goals, and along the way you may want to record a missive or your accomplishments.  You have the ability to add an overall journal entry about what ever, or each goal has its own section to add in notes.

### Design
This app is built using the Angular Framework, with a material theme.  The data storage is google firestore.  I would reccomend both Angular and Firestore, for other projects of similar scope.  Angular as framework, made designing and building this really simple.  Also with a seamless integration with material, gave a polished web UI with very little effort.  Firestore is a great No-SQL datastorage.  Creating and using the collections was a breeze, and its documentation is fairly well written.

### Final thoghts
I really enjoyed this project, and I am looking forward to my next.  If you have any suggestions or issues, please drop me a line at carlsonpar@gmail.com or open a pull request, enjoy.
